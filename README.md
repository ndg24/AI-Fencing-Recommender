# AI Fencing Reccommender

## Introduction
This research project, conducted in collaboration with NYU CS Prof. Jean-Claude Franchitti, focuses on developing intelligent Autonomous Networked (IAN) solutions using cloud-based machine learning, deep learning techniques, and IOT. The project aims to create advanced systems capable of analyzing fencing actions in video clips, providing valuable feedback to fencers through the use of sophisticated recommender systems.

- **TensorFlow**: The industry-standard deep learning framework empowers us to construct and train complex neural networks, enabling high-level action classification.
- **OpenCV**: Utilizing OpenCV, we conduct sophisticated video analysis, including Optical Flow techniques, to gain deeper insights into fencing maneuvers.
- **Docker**: We harness Docker's containerization capabilities to create reproducible development environments, ensuring consistent performance across setups.
- **Amazon AWS**: Our project scales on the cloud, employing Amazon AWS to host the intricate UI, conduct model training, and offer efficient deployment strategies.
- **Python Libraries**: We employ a suite of Python libraries such as NumPy, hickle, and Matplotlib, optimizing data manipulation, storage, and visualization for robust analysis.

## Advanced Features
Our research project incorporates a range of advanced features that showcase the depth of our work:
